- Install LivePreview Extension
- (optional) Install scalene vscode extension

# 0: introduction to scalene
## how to read a scalene profile
## how to use codecarbon

# Activity 1: Optimize existing (apparently clean) code with memory leakage and fix it => 15 min

# Activity 2: csv processing optimization + numpy => let each participant build a solution and then compare profiles, try to optimize => 20-30 min
=> define code objective and find csv data
=> let participants compete for best code

# Activity 3: Diagnose a I/O bottleneck and fix it => 15 min
=> multithreading for IO
=> multiprocessing for CPU-intensive

# Activity 4: optimize gpu utilization on a deep learning training task (preprocess batch with cpu while previous one is in gpu) => 20 min
